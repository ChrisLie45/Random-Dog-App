## Introduction

Welcome to the "Random Dogs" app! This app is built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and displays photos of random dogs.
I built this as i am relearning React Native.  

## Features

-   The app uses the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to retrieve pictures of random dogs and displays them on the screen.
-   The user can refresh the page to see a new dog picture.
